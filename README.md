Background

(Assesses: LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4)

  The top reason for project failure is the project itself. Wrong

projects are ones that defy conventional business rationale,

creating outputs that either few people want, that add little to no

real value, or that undershoot the desired benefits because they

are so difficult to achieve. In short, they fail in rationale and

objective reasoning. They are sometimes called   white elephants.    

(Wu  Misra, 2023)

Task

Part A: Critical Path Analysis

Description of Requirements: You are employed as a Project Manager at

Comarda, and you have been awarded a contract to develop a new automated

inventory control system for Assum Pullum Express, a new fast-food chicken chain

opening several stores across New South Wales. The project's scope and work

breakdown structure have already been decided upon. Tasks and their contents,

durations, and resource requirements are shown in Table 1. Predecessors of tasks

imply which tasks must be conducted before the current task can be started.

a. Create a network diagram using the activity on node (AON) notation

representing the project, as presented in the unit.

(2 marks)

 Identify the Critical Path: Use the table to determine the task

sequence that forms the critical path.

 Calculate Start and Finish Times: For each task, calculate the

earliest start (ES), earliest finish (EF), latest start (LS), and latest finish

(LF) times.

 Calculate Slack Time: Determine the slack time for each task.

 You may use PowerPoint to draw and copy the diagram into your

assignment document. You should not use Microsoft Project or

any other project management software for this part of the

assignment.

b. In the context of the above project with Assum Pullum Express, explain

possible key challenges in managing projects using its critical path. Please

use appropriate references to support your explanation. (3 marks)

Part B: Project Analysis

Project management is a critical discipline in business. It aims to ensure that projects

are within scope, completed on time, within budget, and to the desired quality

standards. However, not all projects succeed. Understanding why projects fail is

essential for future project managers to learn from past mistakes and improve their

skills. This assessment aims to provide students with a comprehensive

understanding of the complexities and challenges in project management by

analysing real-world examples of failed projects.

Importance of Analysing Failed Projects

 Learning from Mistakes: Analysing failed projects helps identify common

pitfalls and mistakes, providing valuable lessons for future projects.

 Risk Management: Understanding the risks that led to project failures can

improve risk management strategies.

 Improving Processes: Insights from failed projects can improve project

management processes and methodologies.

 Stakeholder Communication: Failed projects often highlight stakeholder

communication and management issues, offering lessons on how to handle

these aspects better.

 Innovation and Adaptation: Learning from failures encourages innovation

and adaptation, helping project managers to be more flexible and responsive

to changes.

You are to conduct independent research and select a recent project (in the last 5

years) that can be considered a failure (from a project management perspective  C time,

cost, budget).

To accomplish this,

1. Students are required to select one of the following recent failed projects,

conduct a detailed analysis, and present their findings in a report. The report

should cover the following aspects:

INFS6071: Individual Assignment 1, S2-2024

4

Project Overview: Brief description of the context (country, industry,

markets, company, products/services), the project, its objectives, and key

stakeholders.

 Potential Reasons for Failure: Detailed analysis of the key factors that

potentially led to the project's failure. There could be contradictory

indicators or varied ideas presented in the literature. These reasons

should be linked back t代 写NFS6071、Java/Python
代做程序编程语言o the Project Management Performance Domains

and Project Principles.

 Impact: Examination of the impact of the failure on the organisation and

stakeholders.

 Lessons Learned and Recommendations: Key lessons that can be

learned from the project failure. Suggestions for how the project could

have been managed differently to avoid failure.

Notes

1. Have a proposed project management case study to present to your tutor in

your week 6 tutorial.

2. All requirements about the case under investigation should be clearly

addressed (Support your argument using appropriate references  Ce.g. news,

trade press and academic).

3. You may investigate a problem that occurred anywhere in the world, but all

references, including the incident's source of information, must be available in

English.

The Deliverable

Total written report: 2000   10% words (excluding in-text references and reference

list).

Part A: Critical Path Analysis ? 400 words

Part B: Case Study Analysis ? 1600 words

Note: Please use tables, diagrams, and charts to prepare a

concise response.

Submission Requirements

Submit your report (Individual Assignment 1) by the due date shown on Canvas.

You will find the link to submit the report in the Assignment section of Canvas.

The report should be formatted using A4 paper size, 1.5 line spacing, 2.5cm margins,

and a sans-serif font size of at least 12pt (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, Calibri, Aptos).

Late submissions will be penalised in accordance with the University and Business

School Policy as set out in the UoS outline.

Artificial Intelligence

This assignment is considered a   Lane 2  C Examples of human-AI collaboration in

  assessment as learning     assessment type.

You are permitted to use generative AI to help you; this use must be

acknowledged. For example, you may use AI tools such as (ChatGPT, Google

Gemini, and Microsoft CoPilot) to brainstorm ideas for your assignment. You may

use AI tools such as (Grammarly, Notion AI, ChatGPT, etc.) to directly suggest

readability improvements to your text in terms of grammar and expression.

Do not post confidential, private, personal, or otherwise sensitive information into

these tools. If you use these tools, you must be aware of their limitations, biases, and

propensity for fabrication. Your use of AI tools must adhere to the Student Charter

2020, including upholding honesty, ethics, professionalism, and academic integrity.

Acknowledgement of AI

If you use any AI tools, you need the following:

1. An acknowledgement:

I acknowledge using [insert tool name] to [what the tool did] on . With the

. What then happened?

For example, I acknowledge using ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) to refine the

academic language of my own work. On 1 July 2024, I submitted my entire essay to

refine the academic language of my own work. The original essay can be found here

[link]. With the prompt:   For the following essay, can you improve the academic tone

and accuracy of language, including grammatical structures, punctuation and

vocabulary?  . The output [link] was then modified further to better represent my tone

and style of writing.

2. Copies of the work before and after using the AI tools  C see above for links in

the acknowledgement.

3. The output produced by AI tools is non-deterministic (i.e., another person

cannot obtain the same information as you did); thus, citing AI tools is not a

source and is inappropriate for an assignment.

Assessment Criteria

The individual assignment weighting equals 25% of your final grade.

General explanation of standards: Please refer to the grade descriptors located on

Canvas. These grade descriptors are used to construct marking schemes for all

assessment items.
